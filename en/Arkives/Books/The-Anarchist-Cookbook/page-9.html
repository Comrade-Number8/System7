                This is a brutal book-sensual, rude, coarse, and cruel.
                However, it is timely and well-written, even witty. Profes-
                sionally and painstakingly, all possible informative instruc-
                tions for individual actions of destruction having a pre-
                sumably social effect are detailed here.

                There is no political merit in publishing this book; is is
                not a call to action. For the real Hippy and Yippy, espe-
                cially for the rebellious student, it hardly contains anything
                basic that he does not already know. I belive that it is
                usualy the "square guy" who wants to know what is going
                on, though (or because) shocked and even tantalized by
                such subjects. More often than not it is the subscriber to
                <i>Reader's Digest</i> and <i>Time</i> who constitutes the literary mar-
                ket for such boring commodities as, for example, Games
                People Play.
